\chapter{Declaration of AI Tools}

In this report ChatGPT and DeepL were used for translations as well as grammar and spelling checks. Additionally we used ChatGPT to improve certain sentences, but all prompt where of the type
"Improve [...]", "Point out errors in [...]", "Check [...] for spelling and grammar errors." In addition, we used the integrated AI from overleaf for spelling and grammar checks. An AI tool did not create new content and we checked all texts and translations. We take full responsibility for the results included in this report.
