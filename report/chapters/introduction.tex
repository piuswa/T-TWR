\chapter{Introduction}
{NOTE: Not sure what to say here. I'd just give an overview of how we tackled the problem.
Describing the LILYGO device would be a good thing to do here instead of in Execution.

Alternative:
Explain everything about process in process and here, explain all the tools and methods used, like barker codes, mod/demod etc., assuming readers are not limited to seminar participants -> I think this might be appreciated by Tschudin}





The initial goal of this project was to[...] But we quickly realized that [...] turned out to be harder to implement than we thought. This led us to approach the problem step by step. \\

The first step was to achieve a working connection between the two devices. This turned turned out to be a challenge, since there was a considerable amount of noise. To mitigate the noise and make sure a clean signal could be received, we used [...]. This solved the problem elegantly and made the connection between both devices more reliable.
