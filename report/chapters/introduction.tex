\chapter{Introduction}
{NOTE: Not sure what to say here. I'd just give an overview of how we tackled the problem.
Describing the LILYGO device would be a good thing to do here instead of in Execution.

Alternative:
Explain everything about process in process and here, explain all the tools and methods used, like barker codes, 2FSK etc., assuming readers are not limited to seminar participants -> I think this might be appreciated by Tschudin}





The initial goal of this project was to set up radio communication between two Arduino T-TWR development boards completely from scratch to transmit data in the radio frequency spectrum. After intense trial and error, we discovered that directly accessing and interacting with the radio frequency chip on the board was not possible.\\

After recognizing this limitation in close communication with Prof. Dr. Tschudin, we decided to try transmitting data over the audio frequency range.

The first step was to achieve a working connection between the two devices. This turned turned out to be a challenge, since there was a considerable amount of noise. To mitigate the noise and make sure a clean signal could be received, we used [...]. This solved the problem elegantly and made the connection between both devices more reliable.

\section{Organization}
Our group consists of two teams. Both teams worked together to implement the basic functionality needed to send and receive information via the radios. The rest of the work was split between two teams for more effective time management.

\subsection{Team 1}
Group 1 focuses on creating a packet format that uses synchronisation to determine the beginning of the message and uses forward error correction. The packet is composed of two blocks, one block of fixed length which holds the length of the second block. The second block contains the actual message. The fixed size block is defined to have a length of 8 bits, limiting the maximum message length to $2^8-1$ characters.
For the forward error correction, every 4 bits are encoded using Hamming codes.
\subsection{Team 2 - Modulation}
Team 2 implements modulation at the sender side and demodulation at the receiver side. The modulation is implemented using 2-FSK, where "1" is represented by the frequency 1200 Hz and "0" by the frequency 600 Hz. The sender plays each frequency for a set duration of 63 milliseconds.
