\chapter{Discussion}

TODO: Give me a list of things we did well + not well
Then I can do this section.

Good:
\begin{itemize}
    \item everything on device itself and works:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item modulation
        \item demodulation
        \item packet format
        \item message transmission
        \item forward error correction
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Bad:
\begin{itemize}
    \item slow transmission rate (1 Byte per second with error correction)
    \item only FSK
    \item no Fourier Transform (instead we are counting zeros)
    \item only do it with audio and not radio waves itself
    \item we attempted to use "low density parity check"-codes for error correction, but creating an implementation ourselves was more complex than expected and instead we found a library for hamming codes that worked.
\end{itemize}
