\chapter{Abstract}

This report describes the results of a group work done as part of the HS 2024 Seminar Radio Packet Networks (72913-01), teached by Prof. Dr. Christian Tschudin. It explains how we were able to successfully encode, send and decode messages between two LilyGo T-TWR modules using the build-in radio transponder.
